Hi me,
theme_head this starter theme is missing a few things still....

most urgently

 - pagination or the previous/next page BUTTONS

other stuff

 - archive.php
 - comments.php
 - and probably need some template pages??

 Also check the wp 2017 theme and see how they use the template parts and then call them up when needed



head
 - don't put stuff in the head like font-awesome. Use thewp_enqueue_style(); in functions.php
